  For a bug, if possible, the following information should be included:
    - A short description of the issue and what it affects.
    - How to replicate it or related screenshots (without personal user data).
    - Which users it affects.
    - Who reported the issue/how it was reported (e.g. through the inbox).
-->

<!---
  Make sure the issue is labelled correctly (see https://github.com/isisbusapps/ISISBusApps/wiki/Labels):
    - Choose the correct area(s)
    - Choose the correct type(s)
    - Choose the correct status

  Does this affect the users? If so, it needs to be communicated with the major stakeholders 
  through the Product Owner.
